Dear all,

Below I give you a list of CPOS and POS categories. Regarding FEATS, =
these
are the most important features:

- KAS -> case (ERG(ative), ABS(olutive), DAT(ive) ...)
- ASP -> aspect (for verbs)
- ERL - relation (relative sentence, completive sentence, indirect =
question,
...)

As for the syntactic relations, most of them are taken from Carroll et =
al.
1998, and they maintain the english names in most of the cases.

You can ask us any additional information. This will also help us having =
a
better treebank documentation.

IZE	-> N
	ARR	-> common
	IZB	-> proper names
	LIB	-> place names
	ZKI	-> number

ADJ	-> ADJ
	ARR	-> common
	GAL	-> question

ADI	-> V
	SIN	-> simple
	ADK	-> composed
	ADP	-> periphrastic
	FAK	-> factitive

ADB	ADBERB
	ARR	-> common
	GAL	-> question

DET	-> DET
	ERKARR	-> demonstrative common
	ERKIND	-> demonstrative emphatic
	NOLARR	-> indefinite common
	NOLGAL	-> indefinite question
	ZNB	-> number
	DZH	-> definite
	BAN	-> distributive
	ORD	-> ordinal
	DZG	-> indefinite
	ORO	-> general

IOR	-> pronoun
	PERARR	-> personal common
	PERIND	-> personal emphatic=09
	IZGMGB	-> indefinite=20
	IZGGAL	-> question
	BIH	-> ???
	ELK	-> ???

LOT	-> link
	LOK	-> conector
	JNT	-> conjunction

PRT	-> particle
ITJ	-> interjection
BST	-> other

ADL	-> auxiliary verb
ADT	-> synthetic verb
SIG	-> achronym
SNB	-> symbol
LAB	-> abbreviation

Best regards,
Koldo

Asunto: Re: Basque CoNLL treebank

Dear Koldo,

could you please provide me with a list of the Basque tags, used in the=20
treebank, with their brief explanation. I tried to find the info in the=20
papers referenced from README but without success. I am potentially=20
interested in the values of the CPOS, POS, FEAT and DEPREL columns,=20
although CPOS interests me the most at this moment.

Thank you very much
Dan Zeman
