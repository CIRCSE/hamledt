SETimes.HR treebank (Croatian)
http://nlp.ffzg.hr/resources/corpora/setimes-hr/
We got from Željko Agić on 16 July 2014 a newer and cleaner version than the one that was available on-line at the moment.

License: CC BY-SA 3.0

The original data was not split to training, development and test. We take the first 80% for training, 10% for development
and 10% for testing.

original size = 3736 sentences, 83640 tokens
training size = 3362 sentences, 75236 tokens
dev size      =  374 sentences,  8140 tokens
test size     =  374 sentences,  8404 tokens

The corpus is available in the CoNLL-X (CoNLL 2006) file format.
All lemmas and morphosyntactic tags have been assigned manually (unlike in the older version available online;
for this version it has been confirmed by Željko).
Morphosyntactic tags use the Multext-East 4.0 tagset.
