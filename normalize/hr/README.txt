We got from Željko Agić on 16 July 2014 a newer and cleaner version than the one that was available on-line at the moment.

The original data was not split to training and test. We take the first 90% for training and the rest for testing.

original size = 3736 sentences, 83640 tokens
training size = 3362 sentences, 75236 tokens
test size     =  374 sentences,  8404 tokens

The corpus is available in the CoNLL-X (CoNLL 2006) file format.
Lemmas and morphosyntactic tags have been probably assigned manually, at least in part of the corpus (according to their website).
Morphosyntactic tags use the Multext-East 4.0 tagset.
