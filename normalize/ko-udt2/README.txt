Original split from Google:

training size    = 5437 sentences, 60621 tokens
development size =  603 sentences,  6438 tokens
test size        =  299 sentences,  2631 tokens

Due to the rules of the CoNLL 2017 shared task we have to re-split:

4400 sentences of original train = our train:                      4400 sentences, 49142 tokens
950 sentences of original train = our dev:                          950 sentences, 10402 tokens
87 sentences of original train + original dev and test = our test:  989 sentences, 10146 tokens
