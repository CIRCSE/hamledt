The Irish UD Treebank is a conversion of the Irish Dependency Treebank (IDT).
IDT development is a work-in-progress as part of a PhD research project by
Teresa Lynn at Dublin City University, Ireland. The IDT data has not yet been
officially released. The Treebank contains 1020 sentences taken from the New
Corpus of Ireland-Irish (NCII), with text from books, newswire, websites and
other media.

The conversion from the IDT annotation scheme to the UD annotation scheme was
designed by Teresa Lynn and Jennifer Foster at Dublin City University, Ireland.
