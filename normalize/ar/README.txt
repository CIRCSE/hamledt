Problem: the is_member attribute is lost.
We are currently (May 2013) preparing new Arabic data from PADT 2.0 (unreleased).
The data is more than twice larger than CoNLL 2007.
It should also be better annotated.
We will read directly the native PML data format, so no attributes should be lost this time.
