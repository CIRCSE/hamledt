The gold annotation for the TDT official test set is not publicly
distributed. Instead, you can submit your parser output on the file
fi_ud_test-official.conllu to the evaluation service at the
address below. The service will compare your parser output against the
gold standard and will give you the scores for a number of standard
metrics. These are to be considered the "official" test set results.

The files fi_ud_devel.conllu and fi_ud_test.conllu are obtained by
splitting the original development set of TDT into two equally-sized
parts.
