HamleDT (HArmonized Multi-LanguagE Dependency Treebank) is a compilation of
existing dependency treebanks (or dependency conversions of other treebanks),
transformed so that they all conform to the same annotation style. For more
information please see the project website at

http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/hamledt

This repository contains makefiles and support scripts needed for HamleDT
development. You also need Treex and Interset, which are in separate
repositories. In particular, the tree transformation and harmonization code
is part of Treex (implemented as Treex blocks), see the ufal/treex Github
repository.
