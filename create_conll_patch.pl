# Reads CoNLL 2006 file, removes form + lemma + cpos + pos and prints the result.
# This way we create a treebank patch that contains only morphosyntactic features (possibly Interset) and syntactic annotation.
# Such a file should be freely redistributable because it does not enable the users to reconstruct the original treebank;
# they must have obtained it separately from the legal distributor.
