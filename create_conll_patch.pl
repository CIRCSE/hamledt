# Reads CoNLL-U file, removes form + lemma + pos and prints the result.
# This way we create a treebank patch that contains only universal POS tag + features and syntactic annotation.
# Such a file should be freely redistributable because it does not enable the users to reconstruct the original treebank;
# they must have obtained it separately from the legal distributor.
